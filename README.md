# Image_Analysis
### Solar image analysis using NASA SDO satellite data, without using solar physics specific libraries like Sunpy.

#### The notebook Intensity_Thresholding.ipynb details simple techniques that can be used to enhance features in an image. In our case, we use solar images and enhance the visibility of a solar flare that is captured in the image. We end up using a series of images for this particular solar flare and plot a lightcurve. 

#### The notebook Background_Subtraction.ipynb shows another commonly used technique to enhance features on images. We use images of a solar storm or a Coronal Mass Ejection as it erupts from the Sun.
